The Clever Player Chooses cells at random, until he finds an cell with
his mark. Then he checks all the surrounding cells and looks for empty cells.
the clever player will always choose the first empty cell he finds.
If there are no empty cells in the surrounding, he "gives up" and chooses an cell at random
(using the playTurn() method of the whatever player).

The SnartyPamts uses the same strategy like the clever player,
but he doesn't give up until he finds an empty cell near a cell with his mark.

The whatever player chooses a cell at random.
He chooses random indexes for the row and column to mark, using the advantage of the
putMark() method, which returns true or false if the mark was put on the game board.
He doesn't stop until he gets what he wants and chooses cells at random,
until the cell is a blank one.
